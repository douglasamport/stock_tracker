# stock_tracker

I really enjoy building spreadsheets to track and analyze data in my life, and ruby seems like the pefect tool to help simplify that process.  
This is my first Off curriculum project so if you're actually reading this and see glaring issues please reach out.

The stock tracker
1. Read's price and share data from a google spreadsheet.   
  a. Current stock Data is imported to the spreadsheet using the built in Google sheets 
  b. current crypto data is imported using coingeko.api
2. Analyze different stock stategies and output to a new worksheet

TODO:
1. Need to automate the output so it runs daily at close of markets 
2. Add historical data
3. Visualize strategy data using Google Graphs
4. Build a Front end Dashboard to add & remove stocks and update with purchases
  a. if possible  import data directly from Robinhood or other sources as required.
